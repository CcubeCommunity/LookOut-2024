## Getting Started and Guidelines

To set the tone for a successful cybersecurity journey, follow these guidelines:

1. **Comprehensive Write-Up**: Keep a detailed write-up that encompasses your approach, the resources you utilized, problem-solving strategies, and challenges you encountered during the tasks.
   - **Note: You will be required to submit the writeup later.**

2. **Linux Environment**: Optimize your performance by completing the tasks within a Linux environment. Discover three methods to access the Linux terminal at the end of this document.

3. **Communication**: Stay connected via Web Telegram or Telegram Desktop while completing tasks, and keep notifications on for a seamless community engagement experience.

4. **Assistance**: When in doubt, don't hesitate to use Google or reach out for help from [Goutham](https://t.me/iHaveSystemctl) and [Sangeetha](https://t.me/sangeeetaa).

5. **Points Not for Assessment**: It's important to note that you won't be assessed based on the points you receive in Cyberstart. Feel free to use hints from Cyberstart and leverage Google for further learning.

## Three Approaches to Access the Terminal 🖥️

1. **Dual Boot**: Set up a dual-boot configuration to experience an authentic Linux environment.
   - Pros: Replicates a true Linux experience.
   - Cons: Requires backup measures and disabling secure boot for Windows 11.

2. **Virtual Machine (Recommended)**: Utilize VMware or VirtualBox to create a virtual Linux machine.
   - Pros: Safe and risk-free in terms of data loss.
   - Cons: Requires higher system resources but provides an accurate Linux environment.

3. **Install WSL or Third-Party Terminal for Windows**: If you wish to keep Windows while experimenting with Linux, consider installing Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or a third-party terminal.
   - Pros: No data risk, suitable for lower-spec systems.
   - Cons: May not replicate an exact Linux experience.
